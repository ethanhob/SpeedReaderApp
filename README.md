# Speed Reader App
This app takes paragraphs, parses it into an array and then changes the reading speed (via slider) by influencing the setInterval frequency. 

This used jquery mobile and was my first experience in using UI elements to interact with javascript. 

This was also done using es5 as that is what the tutorial used. This was largely about exploring jquery mobile and exploring the link between UI elements and JS.
